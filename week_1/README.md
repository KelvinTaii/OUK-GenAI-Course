# Reply Manager with BYLLM (Gemini)

This project implements a **social media reply manager** using [Jaclang](https://jac-lang.org/), [BYLLM](https://byllm.ai/), and **Google Gemini** as the LLM backend.

The system reads social media comments and decides how to respond:

* If the comment is a **question**, the LLM generates a polite, relevant reply.
* If the comment is **praise/positive feedback**, the system thanks the user warmly.
* Otherwise, it sends a **generic thank-you message**.

---

## Features

âœ… Uses **Jaclang** for walker-based logic.
âœ… Integrates **BYLLM** to call LLMs (Gemini).
âœ… Hybrid logic â†’ combines **AI classification** + **rule-based fallback**.
âœ… Automatically handles:

* **Questions** â†’ meaningful replies.
* **Positive comments** â†’ warm gratitude.
* **Neutral comments** â†’ generic thank-you.

## Requirements

* **Python 3.10+**
* **Jaclang** (installed via pip)
* **BYLLM** (installed via pip)
* **Gemini API key** (for LLM responses)

---

## Setup

1. **Clone this repo / navigate to project folder**

   ```bash
   cd OUK-GenAI-Course/week_1
   ```

2. **Create and activate a virtual environment**

   ```bash
   python3 -m venv .venv
   source .venv/bin/activate    # Linux/Mac
   .venv\Scripts\activate       # Windows
   ```

3. **Install dependencies**

   ```bash
   pip install jaclang byllm
   ```

4. **Set your Gemini API key**

   ```bash
   export GOOGLE_API_KEY="your-gemini-api-key"   # Linux/Mac
   setx GOOGLE_API_KEY "your-gemini-api-key"     # Windows (PowerShell)
   ```

## Implementation

### File: `reply_manager.jac`

Core logic:

* **LLM functions**

  ```jac
  def classify_comment(comment: str) -> str by llm();
  def answer_question(comment: str) -> str by llm();
  ```

  * `classify_comment`: Returns `"QUESTION"` or `"COMMENT"`.
  * `answer_question`: Generates a polite reply for a question.

* **Walker: `ReplyManager`**

  * Reads a comment.
  * Calls the LLM to classify it.
  * Applies hybrid logic:

    * If `QUESTION` or contains `"?"` â†’ LLM answers.
    * If contains praise words â†’ warm thank-you.
    * Else â†’ generic thanks.

* **CLI Runner**
  Spawns several example comments for testing.
